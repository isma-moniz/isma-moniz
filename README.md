## About me
I'm an informatics engineering student at FEUP. I enjoy programming low level stuff, emulators, videogames and am also interested in cybersecurity, computer networks and systems.

## My projects
Currently I'm maintaining mostly three of my projects: Munnybud, Nestacean and Mazegen. Feel free to check them out!
